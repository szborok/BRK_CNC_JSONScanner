# Archive - Legacy Executable Files

This directory contains the original standalone executable files that have been **consolidated into `main.js` with flags** for better organization and consistency with other CNC management tools.

## Files Moved to Archive

| Original File       | New Flag          | Description                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `debug.js`          | `--debug`         | Debug utilities and log viewing      |
| `demo-readonly.js`  | ~~`--demo-readonly`~~ | ⚠️ **REMOVED** - Redundant (all demos are read-only by design) |
| `demo-temp-only.js` | `--demo-temp`     | Complete temp processing demo (with auto-cleanup) |
| `quick_test.js`     | `--test-quick`    | Quick storage tests                  |
| `test_storage.js`   | `--test-storage`  | Detailed storage functionality tests |

## Migration Complete

✅ **Before**: Multiple executable files in root directory  
✅ **After**: Single `main.js` entry point with organized flags

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Old way (archived)
node debug.js
node demo-readonly.js  # ← This functionality removed as redundant
node quick_test.js

# New way (current)
node main.js --debug
node main.js --demo-temp     # ← All demos are read-only by design
node main.js --test-quick
```

## Benefits of Consolidation

- 🧹 **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files visible
- 🎯 **Single entry point** - Consistent with ClampingPlateManager pattern
- 🚀 **Better organization** - All functionality discoverable via `--help`
- 📖 **Improved documentation** - Built-in help with examples
- 🔧 **Easier maintenance** - One file to manage CLI interface

## Note

These archived files are kept for reference but should not be executed directly. Use the new flag system in `main.js` instead.
